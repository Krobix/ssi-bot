>After speaking for about 45 minutes, King walked over to the young woman and screamed, "wake up!" Then he asked if he was boring her, before suggesting "there's one in every group."

>Roughly 10 minutes later, he had another brief interaction with the girl. It was not discernable what was said, via the YouTube video. He ultimately decided she needed to "take a walk in the back to see where we keep our people who are disrespectful to the court."

>On Wednesday, King told the Free Press he felt disrespected mainly by her body language.

>About two hours later, he had court staff bring her back into the room. At this point she's wearing a green jumpsuit, the words "Wayne County jail" printed on the back. Her hands are cuffed in front of her body.

---

>King asked a lawyer working on a separate hearing in his court to stay and represent the teen. The lawyer, a public defender, said the teen had not slept well the night before. She was tired, nervous and did not understand the seriousness of King addressing the group, the lawyer said.

---

>Later, he asked chaperones to come forward and speak about the young girl's character. They describe her as respectful and a hard worker.

He detained this girl for hours and held a mock trial, that included an actual lawyer and character witnesses, to determine if he should send her to juvie. *Over falling asleep.*<|eols|><|endoftext|>

3 kg kapusty kiszonej

20 dag słoniny

50 dag karczku

50 dag wołowiny od kotleta

30 dag kiełbasy zwyczajnej

20 dag boczku wędzonego

5 grzybów suszonych

koncentrat pomidorowy

papryka słodka w proszku

1 czubata łyżka majeranku

ziele angielskie

liść laurowy

4 duże cebule

Kapustę kiszoną 2 razy zagotować w wielkim garze, odlać wodę. W osobnym garnczku przetopić słoninę i wrzucić pokrojone kawałki mięsa. Mięso zrumienić i dodać 2 pokrojone w plastry cebule. Poddusić i dolać trochę wody. Gotować około 15 minut. Powstanie z tego gulasz. Po ugotowaniu wlać gulasz do kapusty kiszonej, wrzucić parę listków laurowych i ziele angielskie.

Teraz przystępujemy do krojenia kiełbasy i boczku. Wrzucamy na roztopioną słoninę i dodajemy pokrojoną cebulę. Całość dusimy i wrzucamy do gara z kapustą.

Grzyby namoczyć 1 godzinę i pokroić w paski. Wrzucić do gara z kapustą. Wszystko gotować 2 godziny, dodać koncentrat pomidorowy, pół paczki sproszkowanej papryki. Ponownie gotować 2 godziny.

Pod koniec gotowania dodać majeranek i zrobić zasmażkę z 3 łyżek mąki. Bigos będzie jeszcze smaczniejszy, gdy na drugi dzień podgotujemy go ponownie.<|eols|><|endoftext|>

They spent a lot of money up front (this is all speculation by the way and I could be full of shit here); and maybe couldn’t recover the upfront costs. So he made a very calculated mistake: he decided to take a chance that the province wouldn’t be shut down. And when he heard Ford make the announcement, he decided to create a few “harmless” videos showing him at home, which he then posted after getting to his holiday destination. He was sure he wouldn’t be caught. But even if he was, maybe he’d just apologize and his boss would forgive him.

He had his whole career ahead of him. He may have even thought one day he’d be premier.

After some research (as thorough as you can get with the little information/literature available), I concluded vaping is likely safer with some conditions of course (high VG, zero flavor, MTL, low power). My concern with the iQOS was mostly around the question marks plaguing the data and study design from PMI. I have yet to reach a conclusion regarding Snus. There's a lot to consider when looking at new modes of nicotine delivery, never be fooled by the marketed simplicity.<|sor u/Keighlon|>Vaping is safer regardless. Pg has been nebulized and inhaled for 70 years. A mtl won't properly vaporize a high vg blend as they are designed for a 70/30 or less. You dont need low power because power is relevant to ohms. Flavorings would be your most likely "danger" but it would be the sucralose most companies use that should be the real concern.  

You arent going to reach 600 degrees with a wet coil if you're worried about formaldehyde. And if you're worried about formaldehyde worry about milk instead. And tobacco. Worry about the tobacco that has formaldehyde on it on purpose.<|soocr|>I've been vaping practically pure VG with an MTL and never had an issue though. I don't particularly think VG is chemically safer than PG, but my choice of VG, along with lower power for any given resistance, is the lower temperature (of coil and vapour). Chemically, lower temperature is always a safer bet (although with pure base and no flavor of any sort, this isn't a worry), and biologically, high temperatures are quite detrimental on many fronts.<|soocr|>Which tank are you using? I'd suggest an aspire nautilus x if you can find one as it was specifically designed to be a mtl that utilizes higher vg.<|soocr|>The Innokin Zenith with 0.5 ohm plexus coil.

The minister is missing the historical context of Goebbels' "big lie," which is that it was a government propaganda tool.  The journalist posted pictures of water logged areas, which is a thing that happened, and then the minister posted pictures of those same areas the next day after the water drained, which were also real pictures, along with the Goebbels quote.  Both of them posted real pictures but the "big lie" isn't what the journalist said, it's the minister's denial of what the journalist said.<|sor u/AfterReview|>I don't know all the details, but I do know sometimes water can pool like that for mere minutes in heavy rains before draining away. I see this happen in my own gravel parking area sometimes.

So, is this a reporter taking a picture at the worst possible time to portray something that isn't common? Is it very common and the politician is denying that reality? Without more details and facts, I can't say for certain who is bending the truth<|sor u/mathdhruv|>Yeah that's definitely not true of waterlogging on Indian roads. It can last for at least an hour or two after the rain stops, and even if it drains away relatively soon, it still causes massive traffic jams. There was one, a few years ago, which went on for like 14 hours IIRC.

This past week, residents of Gurugram (a satellite city of New Delhi) were asked to work from home, because waterlogging of streets and underpasses was predicted, due to heavy rainfall.

All of which could be prevented, because India has the monsoon season every July-September, so there's a lot of time in the summer to get drains de-silted and improve drainage systems around roads.

It's squarely on the municipal departments (and therefore by extension the ministry) if waterlogging continues to be a problem.<|eols|><|endoftext|>

They probably had a hot water loop so that customers could get hot water quickly instead of having to wait for it to go all the way down the hallway from the tank. 150 also seems too hot, 140 is usually recommended.

Probably turned on full hot, was surprised at how hot it was, fell (as the article said, and being that old, it makes sense), and then couldn't manage to fight through the pain to turn it off.

Perfectly normal behaviour<|soopr|>The judge understood all this and was making this point - except the police prosecution fucked up and charged him with "drug trafficking" but since he never handled any drugs he was rightfully acquitted. The police should've charged him with "attempted drug trafficking".<|sor u/erakat|>Is attempted drug trafficking even a crime? I mean, you can’t go making up laws willy-nilly.<|sor u/pbageant|>&gt;Is attempted drug trafficking even a crime?

yes, it is<|soocr|>I wonder what, apart from this case, actually counts as attempted drug trafficking as opposed to actual trafficking. 

Surely if you have a large amount of a drug (read too much for one person), that should count as actual trafficking and not attempted.<|soocr|>The difference between an attempted crime, and a completed crime (in America) works roughly like this:

\- A person is guilty of a crime if the prosecution can show (1) intent to commit the crime, and (2) the completion of the crime.

\- A person is guilty of attempt if the prosecution can show (1) intent to commit a crime; (2) conduct that constitutes a substantial step toward completing the crime. 

The difference is just whether the actual crime was completed. In this guy's case, he intended to participate in the trafficking of cocaine, and he engaged in "substantial steps" toward that goal by receiving the package, removing what he believed were drugs, and attempting to hide them. He didn't complete an actual crime (because the drugs were swapped with sugar and sugar is not criminal) but he intended to and he took substantial steps. That's attempt. 

Re your section question, if you have a large amount of the drug, the crime (in America) is "possession with intent to distribute." The theory is that you definitely possess it, and it is so much quantity that your intent to distribute it to others is presumed.<|soocr|>The Judge goes onto say that the cops should’ve charged with attempted trafficking.

That didn’t come out right. It is a concern of mine for the schools to be secure, I apologize.”

So a guy misspoke and in the same breath apologized for getting carried away. Definitely crucify him, I'm sure all of us can live up to a higher standard than that. /s

I'm guessing that he meant he faces a ton of issues regarding schools, only one of which is safety. That may not have great optics, but it's true, safety is important and yet schools are more than just secure facilities. Ideally some learning should occur, people get vetted and evaluated and paid on a tight budget, hiring and firing, an ever-changing curriculum, all sorts of political bullshit, and yes safety. He's trying to make schools work in a poor-as-fuck red state that probably hates education, I'm sure it's a nightmare job.

It seems like a question worth asking.

From the JAMA article:

> Based on theory, multivariate models include the presence of an armed guard and control for region, school type (public, nonpublic), and grade level (high school, elementary, other); location (urban, suburban, rural); use of lockdown drills; if the attack was targeted; total number of weapons brought to the scene; number of shooters; and weapon type. Results are presented as incident rate ratios in Table 2 and show armed guards were not associated with significant reduction in rates of injuries; in fact, controlling for the aforementioned factors of location and school characteristics, the rate of deaths was 2.83 times greater in schools with an armed guard present (incidence rate ratio, 2.96; 95% CI = 1.43-6.13; P = .003).<|sor u/Psychomadeye|>>I think there's also something really fucked up about having millions of cops patrolling your schools.

Gender exclusively a social construct. You can be trans without transitioning.

If you would like your sexual characteristics to match the societal gender you feel you are most represented by, you can medically transition, which can take years, and in extreme cases, requires surgery.

You are whatever gender you say you are, because only you know which societally defined gender feels right. If you want to match your sex to that gender and compete in things that are limited by sex on the characteristics typical to a particular sex, then you may need to transition.

König der Schattenlande, Beherrscher der entsetzlichen  Dimensionen, Lenker der abtrünnigen Dämonenlegionen und Herrscher über  die allumfassende Finsternis, dessen düstere Präsenz die Sterne zum  Verlöschen bringt und die Welt in unermessliche Verzweiflung stürzt. Ein  wankender Schrecken in den Hallen der Furcht, ein Malstrom der  ultimativen Vernichtung, ein Unheil, das aus den bodenlosen Abgründen  des Seins emporsteigt, um die Seelen der Sterblichen zu verschlingen und  die Realität in einen endlosen, qualvollen Alptraum zu stürzen, der die  Fundamente der Existenz zerreißt und das Universum in seinem finalen  Untergang versinken lässt. Schrecken ohne Namen, Finsternis ohne  Grenzen, Zerberus des kosmischen Todes, Geborener der Schatten in den  Weiten des Vergessens, der die Zeit in seinen Klauen hält und die  Ewigkeit in seinem Blick trägt, der die Dämmerung selbst verschlingt und  die Dunkelheit als Gefährtin begrüßt, Entität der Dunkelheit, geformt  aus den Schatten der Furcht und gehüllt in das Gewand der Leere, ein  Nichts, das alles verschlingt und die Stille mit seinem Atem erfüllt,  Schöpfer der Vernichtung und Manifestation des Untergangs, der das  Universum in seinen Abgrund reißt und die kosmischen Pfade mit Verderben  säumt, ein Unheil, das jenseits aller Vorstellungskraft existiert und  sich durch die Ewigkeiten windet, das die Menschheit in tiefe  Verzweiflung stürzt und die Schleier des Geheimnisses um die Welt webt,  ein Schrecken, der in den finstersten Tiefen lauert und die Seelen in  ewiger Finsternis fesselt, Geist des Grauens, geformt aus den Albträumen  der Sterblichen und geboren aus der Leere selbst, ein Jäger der Nacht,  der die Schatten manipuliert und das Nichts als seine Domäne betrachtet,  ein Mysterium, das jeden Gedanken durchdringt und die Essenz der  Existenz hinterfragt, Bote des Chaos und Wächter des Todes, lauernd in  den unergründlichen Abgründen und das Universum mit seinem bösen Lachen  erschütternd, eine Manifestation der Dunkelheit und Verkörperung des  Abgrunds, Wesen ohne Anfang und Ende, das in den finstersten Tiefen der  Düsternis erwacht und die Schleier der Realität zerreißt, Schatten, der  über die Zeiten herrscht und die Ewigkeit mit seinem Fluch erfüllt,  Emissär des Verderbens und Sentenz der Vernichtung, Unheil, das in den  Hallen des Schreckens geboren wurde und durch die schwindenden Schleier  des Universums schreitet, Wesen von solcher Dunkelheit, dass es das  Licht selbst zu verschlingen droht und die Macht besitzt, das Schicksal  der Welten zu formen, Schattenherrscher, der aus den verlorenen Träumen  der Sterblichen erwacht und die Säulen der Realität zu erschüttern  vermag, Zerstörer der Ordnung und Schöpfer des Chaos, lenkend die  Schatten und durchdringend die Äonen der Stille, eine Wirklichkeit, die  über das Gewebe der Existenz hinausgeht und die Welt in ihrer  unerbittlichen Dunkelheit umhüllt, Entität des Schreckens und Gottheit  des Verderbens, die aus den Tiefen des Nichts aufsteigt, Seelen zu  verschlingen und die Welt in ewiger Finsternis zu stürzen

&gt;I believe people are faking vax cards. I also believe people make mistakes. Even really dumb mistakes. Even people who work in pharmacies can make just really, really stupid mistakes

Yes, but two people weeks apart making the same mistake was clearly enough to make them suspicious. Hence they checked up and found no vaccine was ever administered. They didn't just take the card as evidence alone.

I agree spelling mistakes happen, but they did dig deeper before acting.<|soocr|>My point was, a spelling error does not necessarily make a card invalid. 'Dave' didn't make my card invalid. That's all I was saying. Every card can be verified or proven false in the database.<|eols|><|endoftext|>

1) see women's rights advance 

*or*

2) see what we call women's rights done away with in favor of Islamic women's rights (an oxymoron btw)

Answer that, and compare it to our base value, in this case western values. He's not just "conservative", he's an extremist. You, your way of life, and your country are his enemy. Any literal interpretation of and devotion to the Abrahamic religions results in extremism, because you're trying to tie together two disparate worlds (violent, sexist Iron Age mythology and modern, secular values.)<|soocr|>What makes you say that he is an Islamic dictator rather than a muslim dictator? 

You could use the same kind of logic for American religiously conservative politicians. In fact you could use that logic against the majority of religiously conservative politicians in Europe as well - few of whom are known to champion women’s rights issues. Suddenly the term extremist is watered down. 

As far as I am aware, Erdogan does not hold any extremist religious views, so even if he is a bad guy I would not classify him as an religious extremist. He does use religion as a political tool (as many in the west do) - but does this warrant a comparison to the likes of Daesh and Al-Qaeda?

While it lacks dogma, it does have a core belief structure that is vigorously defended by its believers. Atheists have been so vocal and so unwavering in their quest for acceptance that they inadvertently turned into the very thing they claim to stand against.<|sor u/yikesladyy|>No, we just don't believe your god claims because you can't prove them. There is no "core belief structure." BTW, atheists are not the assholes who knock on other people's doors trying to shove a bunch of unsubstantiated bullshit down their throats. You people are the overly vocal ones in your quest to convince yourselves that Santa Claus is real.<|soocr|>Ok. First, I'm sensing some projection so let's clear the air. 

I am not a practicing Christian. If anything I'd consider myself an agnostic, which is much more non-religious than an atheist. I'll explain. And please, I wasn't nasty, don't be nasty back. 

Atheism is a core belief structure. Atheists believe (or don't believe, let's not get caught up is semantics) that science is the only right, there is no God, afterlife, spirits, ghosts, or any supernatural existence, right? And they believe that without flexibility. That is the very definition of a religious structure. 

The US military will let you put Atheist as your religion on your dog tags and on your tombstone. Not a blank space, but specifically listed. 

Not believing in a higher power doesn't qualify as being non-religious if something else (science) has taken the place of that higher power as the answer to our problems. 

And I'm not anti-science. I'm not anti-Atheist. I'm just saying that the structure that atheists use is very similar to that of a non-centralized religion like Zoroastriamism.<|eols|><|endoftext|>

So it is unsurprising that a senior French politician’s attack on Spanish tomatoes as “inedible” has sparked what media have dubbed “the tomato war”.

Spanish feathers have been significantly ruffled by the statement by Ségolène Royal, a former environment minister and former presidential candidate. “Have you tasted the so-called organic Spanish tomatoes? They’re inedible!” she said during a television interview.

Royal went on to allege that Spanish organic tomatoes are not organic at all. “Spanish organic is fake organic,” she added. “Spanish fruits and vegetables do not meet French standards and should not be on [supermarket] shelves”.<|eols|><|endoftext|>

Was also interesting to learn that the British had a hand in starting this conflict, not that im at all surprised... We seem to have been behind the majority of historically shitty things.<|soopr|>Here is a video that explains the current war:


https://v.redd.it/f8fwftoiscy61<|soocr|>so what im getting is that their fighting each other, because they've been fighting each other?
I mean i can also find plenty of people saying the other way around (plenty of videos showing mortars falling on cities)

Would not the simplest "solution" to this problem be a joint strike against both governments by a larger entity? Say if Russia/USA moved in against BOTH Israel and Palestine? Either they work together to combat the threat (ending the war) or both fall to the overwhelming might of the larger antagonist (ending the war).<|sor u/torchy33|>No it would not work given that Palestine is not recognized by the U.S. as a state or nation. Any other country besides the United States would not like to get involved, and the extent of most countries right now is either going to the U.N. or shipping weapons to the side that aligns with their political interest.

&amp;#x200B;

Also a "both sides" approach is not realistic and it is naive.  This conflict is older than the people fighting in it who have deep hatred for the opposing side.<|soocr|>was more hoping it'd either be a come together to stand a chance against said threat, or fail and become part of said threat. Either way the conflict ends and fewer lives are lost in the long run (potentially).

It's unlikely it would have been examined if it had no caused concern. Some things are tragic, but necessary. Blame terrorists, not the people ensuring you arrive alive.<|soopr|>The airport has a different view about it: "Dublin Airport has apologised and said the situation should have been handled better."

Also the lady: Ms Ní Leannáin told BBC NI's Evening Extra programme: "The security officer didn't even offer to pat me down. She stood and waited for me to remove the prosthesis."

In other airports, such as Glasgow and Amsterdam, she has been briefly searched or been able to explain her situation.

However her experience at Dublin Airport was very different, she said, and the security officer told her she needed to see her prosthesis.<|sor u/OPtig|>If the prosthesis needs to be examined for explosive  materials then a pat down would not be helpful.<|eols|><|endoftext|>

I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night.

For the swarm they will send out scout bees to find a new suitable location before the swarm eventually departs to its new home.

Ali Khorami has pleaded not guilty to 25 charges related to five female complainants who attended the Woolcock Institute of Medical Research, in Glebe, for various sleep problems in 2018.  
The 49-year-old, who supervised overnight sleep studies, has told his NSW District Court trial he performed tantric healing on two of the patients involving his genitals.  
During an October 2018 police interview, Dr Khorami was presented with a screenshot from overnight CCTV footage showing him placing his penis on a 16-year-old patient's hand.  
On Tuesday he told the court she had told him she was 17.  
"I got consent from her because legally she can make decision about alternative treatment ... any sort of medical treatment," he said.  
"She was not sleeping, she wanted to take this experience."  
At the same time, he took her blood pressure.  
He told the court this was not something he normally did but was "a special treatment for some patients".  
The doctor said he trained for "many, many years" to perform the treatment, which was "not masturbation".  
"Masturbation is for sexual reason, but it's totally different," he said.  
The complainants were aged between 16 and 29.  
Under cross examination, Dr Khorami also denied separate allegations he drugged a 20-year-old woman before she went to bed by spiking her fruit juice with Temazepam.  
The patient made a complaint after feeling abnormally tired the next day and traces of the drug showed up in a urine test.  
He claimed the woman told him in confidence she had taken an unknown medication for stress relief and denied putting anything in her juice.  
The trial, before Judge Leonie Flannery, continues.<|eols|><|endoftext|>

**Rule 1** - Do not alter headlines; copy and paste.  

The title of all submissions needs to match the article headline exactly. **Copy and paste** from the main headline only, do not include anything beyond the primary headline such as byliners, subtitles, flavor text, quotes from the article, news outlet, location, cross post tags, (video) tags, and so on. Do not use the “suggest title” option for posting as it often does not match the headline. As a matter of fairness, any submission with an altered title will be removed. The only exception is that, if an article has a title in all caps, you may change the capitalization to title case, but everything else must remain the same.

<|sols r/shittymoviedetails|><|sot|>In Disney's "Frozen" (2013), the song "Fixer Upper" implies an unsavory and possibly sexual relationship between Kristoff and Sven. There's probably soul-crushing fanfic and fanart of them tenderly making love to each other. Jesus Christ.

<|sols r/shittymoviedetails|><|sot|>Despite his name, actor Adam Driver was not consider for a role in Baby Driver (2017). This is because he was 33 when the film came out, meaning he was an Adult Driver.<|sor u/brotatowolf|>Kevin spacey appeared prominently. This is because he believed that the driver would actually be a baby<|sor u/Sex_E_Searcher|>Man, I'm surprised he's in this.  I thought he was blacklisted after the world admitted he was a sexual predator.<|sor u/Jaz_the_Nagai|>This was before that I believe.<|eols|><|endoftext|>
<|sols r/shittymoviedetails|><|sot|>In the movie Cats, the cat Victoria goes on a massive intergalactic space mission in the movie which is meant to spread awareness about the dying population of space cats in the asteroid belt, or something, I don’t know, I didn’t watch it and neither did you.<|sor u/kowni|>Ngl he had me in the first half<|eols|><|endoftext|>
<|sols r/shittymoviedetails|><|sot|>In The Dark Knight (2008), Harvey Dent makes decisions based on a coin flip, "making his own luck." What most don't realize is that the directors of this movie had already determined the result each time and the coin flip wasn't up to chance.<|eols|><|endoftext|>

<|sols r/shittymoviedetails|><|sot|>In The Rise of Skywalker (2019), Darth Vader's destroyed mask is frequently displayed. This is a nod to Disney destroying Darth Vader's character arc.<|sor u/allout_atl|>Booooo<|eols|><|endoftext|>

<|sols r/shittymoviedetails|><|sot|>In The Lion King (2019) Scar tells Mufasa: "Long live the king," but he is obviously stupid because he throws the king off of a cliff seconds later.<|sor u/1amlost|>This scene doesn’t make sense because there was a scene that was cut from the theatrical release where Scar mentions that it’s Opposite Day.<|sor u/Dragmire800|>But if Scar said that it was Opposite Day, that would imply that it wasn’t Opposite Day. But then why would Scar lie about it being Opposite Day? 

Either way, Lions are large felines<|sor u/aedroogo|>I agree with you there.<|eols|><|endoftext|>
<|sols r/shittymoviedetails|><|sot|>In The Empire Strikes Back (1980), Luke’s lightsaber activates immediately, alluding to the fact that he is young and can get an immediate erection. Conversely, Darth Vader’s lightsaber takes longer to ignite as he is old and has erectile dysfunction.<|sor u/Rotated_text|>Mark Hamill is 5'9, David Prowse is 6'6, it just takes longer for the blood to get down there.<|soopr|>Nah bro Vader’s balls were burned off in Episode III so he couldn’t get a stiffy<|sor u/Jayer244|>Anakin died a virgin lol ^/s<|sor u/Hates_escalators|>Umm, how Padme get preganant them?<|eols|><|endoftext|>
<|sols r/shittymoviedetails|><|sot|>It is actually impossible for Palpatine to have defeated Mace Windu, as neither he nor Anakin had the high ground over Windu, thus making this the only plot hole in the Prequel franchise.<|sor u/mand0rk|>Mace Windu didn’t survive because he didn’t just grab a second lightsaber and cross the two together, disintegrating poppa palp<|eols|><|endoftext|>
<|sols r/shittymoviedetails|><|sot|>The scene from The Last Jedi (2017) where Rey and Kylo Ren fight the guards was staged. Just like the rest of the movie. Disney you bunch of lying bastards<|eols|><|endoftext|>

<|sols r/shittymoviedetails|><|sot|>The ending of Back to the Future is shared by the opening sequence of Back to the Future: Part II. However the sequence had to be completely reshot for the second film because Robert Zemeckis wasn’t able to open any of his files when he put them all on a Mac. Fucking Mac.<|sor u/TimothyAlan|>Actually, I'm pretty sure it's because they changed actresses for his girlfriend. Originally it was Claudia Wells, but then it was changed to Elizabeth Shue for the second, which kinda meant than had to re-shoot the parts of the intro that shows her face.<|sor u/b0nez07|>r/whoosh<|sor u/Jcrouse83|>r/im14andthisiswoooosh<|sor u/notsofitfatguy|>The point of the whoosh is the original commentor truly didnt get the joke/sub.

<|sols r/shittymoviedetails|><|sot|>In Spider-Man 3 (2007), Peter Parker performs finger gun gestures to passersby on the streets. This is a reference to how Uncle Ben died by a gunshot.<|eols|><|endoftext|>
<|sols r/shittymoviedetails|><|sot|>Christopher Nolan famously hates CGI.

<|sols r/shittymoviedetails|><|sot|>In Madagascar, a white police officer asks if he can shoot Marty, a Zebra. This is because the officer couldnt tell if Marty was black with white stripes or white with black stripes.<|eols|><|endoftext|>
<|sols r/shittymoviedetails|><|sot|>In the subversive masterpiece Avengers: Endgame (2019), directors Anthony and Joe Russo made the bold artistic choice to film scenes with a camera, which is why you can see things on the screen.<|sor u/SantaOMG|>Only about 25% of it was with a camera because they ran out of time on their lease and had to return it back to best buy<|eols|><|endoftext|>
<|sols r/shittymoviedetails|><|sot|>Star Wars director J.J. Abrams has stated that the sequel movies are supposed to be pronounced "Episode Seven," "Episode Eight," and "Episode Nine," instead of "Episode Vee", "Episode Veeeeee", and Episode "Icks" as most people would assume.<|eols|><|endoftext|>
<|sols r/shittymoviedetails|><|sot|>In Iron Man 2 (2010), during the Monaco Grand Prix scene, Elon Musk has a cameo in which he meets Tony Stark. This is a reference to the fact that, like Iron Man, Elon Musk is a narcissistic asshole.<|eols|><|endoftext|>
<|sols r/shittymoviedetails|><|sot|>Borat (2006) is actually super violent and not as funny as I expected it to be.<|sor u/powerhower|>No dummy, you watched There Will Be Borat, the spiritual successor to Borat. It follows the same main character but in a different timeline. 

If you don't remember, they introduced infinite universes to the lore in The Berenstain Borats, the web miniseries that was on Pornhub Premium. (This series is considered canon, despite what some claim)

<|sols r/shittymoviedetails|><|sot|>In Cats (2019), about 1/3 through the movie, the characters have lightsabers. This is because I went up to the projector and turned on Star Wars instead so I didn’t have to continue watching this shit.<|eols|><|endoftext|>

The majority of the funding came from the actual bank robbery that was turned into the opening of the film. Millions were hauled away in that school bus from a downtown Chicago location, and three accomplices were truly murdered in the process.

Edit: to save you guys time reading the comment chain with the racist below, basically I'm saying that there's a difference between people making a profit and a profit incentive being the main aspect of the system, otherwise you'd call every government program for-profit too.<|sor u/Chris22533|>How so?<|soocr|>The profit motive is replaced by guaranteed income collected by the state.<|soocr|>And they make more money per prisoner thus they want more people in prison. And since they make a set amount per person they are motivated to cutting down to only providing the bare minimum for survival.

The profit motive is still in place. More prisoners = more money.

Or how do you explain private prisons lobbying for harsher penalties for minor offenses?

This is how privatization has always worked. Public works have plenty so they spend the excess. When they get privatized the businesses start cutting corners and getting the business so that it is barely functioning to maximize profits.<|eols|><|endoftext|>

<|sols r/nottheonion|><|sot|>‘Sexual pleasure a gift from God’ but avoid porn, Pope Francis advises<|soopr|>“Sexual pleasure is a gift from God” but Catholics must avoid pornography, Pope Francis has said.

The pontiff made the remarks during a catechesis devoted to the “vice of lust” at his general audience in Saint Peter’s Square on Wednesday.

Sexual pleasure was something to be cherished, he said, but it was being “undermined by pornography”, and “satisfaction without a relationship can generate forms of addiction”.

“We must defend love,” the pope said. But he added: “Winning against the battle of lust can be a lifelong undertaking.”

Francis appeared to be responding to his conservative critics, who were incensed last week after a book resurfaced featuring sexually explicit content written decades ago by the Vatican’s head of doctrine.

The book, now out of print, by Víctor Manuel Fernández, an Argentinian cardinal close to Francis who was already known as the author of another sexually charged book written in his youth, included a chapter describing the differences between male and female orgasms.

In response to the more recent scandal, Fernández, whose appointment to one of the Vatican’s most powerful positions was criticised by conservative cardinals, told Crux: “I would certainly not write [that] now.”

In 2022, during a talk with seminarians about the dangers of social media, the pope warned against the “devil” of digital pornography, while admitting that priests and nuns also watch online porn. “It is a vice that so many people have. So many laymen, so many laywomen, and also priests and nuns,” he said. “The devil enters from there.”

In late 2020, the Vatican was left in an embarrassing predicament when it was forced to “seek explanations from Instagram” after Pope Francis’s official Instagram, which along with his other social media accounts is managed by a team of people, “liked” a photo of the Brazilian model Natalia Garibotto. The “like” from the pope’s account was visible on Garibotto’s page for several days before being unliked.

The Vatican said at the time: “We can exclude that the ‘like’ came from the Holy See”.<|sor u/Plaidygami|>With proper context, I see nothing wrong or onion-y about it, honestly.<|sor u/KinkyPaddling|>He’s basically just reiterating (in moral terms) the dangers of porn addiction and the effects it has on intimate relationships.<|eols|><|endoftext|>

Lee Harvey used his carcano rifle that he assassinated the president with, to attempt an assassination on a controversial WW2 General in Texas. 

He used the Bugsy Siegel method of trying to snipe the guy out from outside (Siegel was famously sniped out by an M1/M2 carbine in Virginia Hill mansion) 

He also murdered JD Tippet, a police officer and WW2 Medal of Valor recipient, also police Medal of Honor recipient. Tippit attempted to stop LHO for questioning as he fit the description of a man seen at the schoolbook depository and leaving shortly after shots rang out. 

With this information its pretty easy to conclude, LHO did it. Not sure about mafia conspiracy seems it would be the New Orleans boss and Sam Giancana as well as Santo Trafficantes people

But at the time of its discovery, some referred to it colloquially as “N*****head rock,” a commonly used expression at the time to describe any large dark rock.

Which is why, amid a national reckoning over race after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody, Black students at UW-Madison are calling for the removal of the rock that, while a relic of Wisconsin’s rich geological past, also serves as a painful reminder of its pervasive, racist history.<|eols|><|endoftext|>

Theyre not saying that spelling wont affect people's English grades, jfc. Its just sensationalist writing

Edit, also:
&gt;Another university trying this option includes the University of the Arts London.

&gt;New guidelines issued there about marking written work say staff should ‘actively accept spelling, grammar or other language mistakes that do not significantly impede communication unless the brief states that formally accurate language is a requirement’.

&gt;It warns tutors should ‘avoid imposing your own idea of ‘correct English’ on student work’.

However, you’d think she would’ve noticed when she went to turn off the taser’s safety and it wasn’t there. (Glocks and M&amp;Ps use a trigger safety, rather than a thumb safety as found on most tasers)

Edit 1: The officer was apparently a woman. Pronouns updates to the feminine from the generic masculine.

Edit 2: The gun used appears to be a Glock, most likely a G17 or possibly a G19. Both are polymer handguns, so the grips may feel somewhat similar to a taser, but as other comments have rightly stated the weight and grip angle are very different from a taser.<|sor u/[deleted]|>First of all, an all black Glock (that’s what cops in MN carry) even if the grip is plastic.. you’re a cop your gun is your life and last resort.

It's hard to make heads or tails but from what I saw during persuit there was a shot fired toward officers in their vehicles. He then jumped out of the vehicle in a Ski Mask (and unknown to the officers he left his gun in the driver's seat since he started fleeing) one of the officers tried to taze him and things get a bit hard to follow after that even from different angles, but from what I could tell he quickly whipped 180 with a hand coming up from his waist (again no firearm but the police don't know that) and the mixture of adrenaline from the foot chase, his sudden change of direction and there reportedly being a shot fired just moments before pure instinct and reactions took over. I would watch and judge for yourself though and not just read headlines or some of these stories, because Alot of them don't align with what actually happened. They say it was racial when he was wearing a ski mask and in the video you can't tell if he is black blue purple etc, and them stating it was a "simple traffic infraction" left out that he fled from police when they tried to pull him over. Not to mention he DID have a gun with him, it just wasn't on him when he was shot because he immediately fled as soon as he exited the vehicle with police surrounding his car.<|sor u/imakenosensetopeople|>This makes sense, but is also indicative of the problem of officers creating scenarios in which questionable movements can be misinterpreted.  They continued to escalate the situation.

So it was a traffic infraction.  He ran on foot.  Fine.  Take the vehicle and impound it.  They knew who he was.  He will go home eventually.  Pick him up there, peacefully.<|soocr|>I get the train of thought, had there not been a gunshot during the chase MAYBE you could consider that and just put out a warrant and try to scoop him up later. But with a Shot fired there is far more inherint risk that he would stay armed at a later date or injure others if he gets away. It's a hard spot to be in either way for all parties involved.<|soocr|>And I would point out that the shot wouldn’t have been fired if they weren’t actively pursuing on foot.  He didn’t pose any threat that necessitated their continued escalation of violence.

Lol I have successfully bothered the Reddit boot lickers hive mind.  I hope none of you ever find yourself on the wrong end of a misunderstanding with America’s police.  Apparently traffic violations warrant death.<|soocr|>The shot was fired during the vehicle portion of the chase so before foot pursuit it could only be assumed he was armed and dangerous, the hope was the officers attempting to taze him would have been successful but tazers fail more often than people think<|eols|><|endoftext|>
